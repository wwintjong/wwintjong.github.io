                    <p>
                        Makey Makey is a system that utilizes an mmWave radar to send and read millimeter-wavelength signals to detect
                        changes in the object it is scanning from. We developed this system as a way to detect equipments operating 
                        status at our school's makerspace because we think that knowing the availability of certain equipments at the
                        space could save members time from having to traversing far distances across campus. 
                    </p>
                    <!-- <h2>Motivation</h2>
                    <p>
                        Makey Makey was a project for an MIT class called 6.1820 Mobile and Sensor Computing that focuses on Internet of
                        Things (IoT). I worked on this project along with a classmate, and this project was our approach in resolving an issue we
                        encountered frequently when trying to work at one of our school's makerspaces. Specifically, the challenge we were to trying to work
                        on was how to know in advance when certain equipments like the 3D printers or laser cutters are unavailable because
                        someone else is using it. Knowing this information in advance could save members time from traversing far distances only to
                        find out they can't use it right away. My classmate and I decided to proceed with developing a system that could detect
                        the operating status of different equipments.
                    </p> -->
                    <h1>Approach</h1>

                    <p>
                        Our system utilizes Texas Instrument's IWR1443BOOST mmWave radar and a DCA1000 along with it. The system starts
                        out with the radar sending out FMCW pulses directed at the targeted objects, and when these signals reach these
                        objects, they are reflected back towards the direction of the radar. The DCA1000, which is connected to the 
                        radar, then collects these FMCW signals and convert them into a much more convenient form to work with. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once these raw data are collected, we applied FFT and background subtraction to get rid of noises and other 
                        unwanted readings. What we are left with it are essentially peaks indicating the equipments operating status 
                        and anything else as rest or off state.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To test our system, we established a setup as shown in the figure above. The system is placed to the left of 
                        targeted objects we want to test with and the targeted objects are two desktop CNC milling machines. The moment 
                        we start operation on the CNC machines, we enabled sampling on the radar, and after a few seconds, the system is 
                        able to output machines status. As seen in the demo below, we manage to get the system to detect each of the machines 
                        independently. At the time, the space we were working on were busy, but we were able to have the system ignore them 
                        and focus only on the CNC machines. Of course, some misreadings came up, and the detection fell off at times in the 
                        video. This is because the lab we were at had many sources of noises, so although we tried to account for that in our 
                        algorithm, some managed to get through and effect the detection.

                    <h1>Challenges</h1>
                    <p>
                        This project did came with several obstacles when we were working on it. The first one we encountered was how to use 
                        mmWave radar. Although the class taught us the basics of mmWave radar, they did not prepared us in using them nor did 
                        they have resources to help us. We browsed through the internet, and unfortunately, there was little documentions. What 
                        we ended up doing was to learn through trials and errors, which took about two weeks. This was troubling for us as when 
                        we started on this project, we had a month of time to work on it, so after we understand the basics of using the radar,
                        we had about two weeks left to actually implement our system and test it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another problem that occurred happened when we were testing the system. The space we were at has many sources of noises 
                        coming from all directions around the radar. Furthermore, we found that the noise readings falls close to the machines' 
                        frequencies, meaning the radar could mistaken it as the machines being on. To mitigate this, we had to enclose the radar 
                        from all but one side that face towards the CNC machine. This method was crude and does not fully resolve the noise issue 
                        but it significantly prevents false positive readings.
                    </p>
                    <h1>Wrap-Up</h1>
                    <p>
                        Overall, this project was fun to work on, and I gained valuable experience working with an IoT hardware. Had we 
                        more time to work on this, we could probably fine tune this project to account for some of the problems mentioned earlier. I 
                        thought learning how to use the mmWave radar with limited resources was an interesting exploration that gave me many new project 
                        ideas. However, my partner and I agreed that perhaps that there are hardware better than the mmWave radar suited for this project.
