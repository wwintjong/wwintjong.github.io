                    <p>
                        Makey Makey is a system that utilizes an mmWave radar to send and read millimeter-wavelength signals to detect
                        changes in the object it is scanning from. We developed this system as a way to detect equipments operating 
                        status at our school's makerspace because we think that knowing the availability of certain equipments at the
                        space could save members time from having to traversing far distances across campus. 
                    </p>
                    <!-- <h2>Motivation</h2>
                    <p>
                        Makey Makey was a project for an MIT class called 6.1820 Mobile and Sensor Computing that focuses on Internet of
                        Things (IoT). I worked on this project along with a classmate, and this project was our approach in resolving an issue we
                        encountered frequently when trying to work at one of our school's makerspaces. Specifically, the challenge we were to trying to work
                        on was how to know in advance when certain equipments like the 3D printers or laser cutters are unavailable because
                        someone else is using it. Knowing this information in advance could save members time from traversing far distances only to
                        find out they can't use it right away. My classmate and I decided to proceed with developing a system that could detect
                        the operating status of different equipments.

                    <p>
                        Our system utilizes Texas Instrument's IWR1443BOOST mmWave radar and a DCA1000 along with it. The system starts
                        out with the radar sending out FMCW pulses directed at the targeted objects, and when these signals reach these
                        objects, they are reflected back towards the direction of the radar. The DCA1000, which is connected to the 
                        radar, then collects these FMCW signals and convert them into a much more convenient form to work with. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once these raw data are collected, we applied FFT and background subtraction to get rid of noises and other 
                        unwanted readings. What we are left with it are essentially peaks indicating the equipments operating status 
                        and anything else as rest or off state.

                        To test our system, we established a setup as shown in the figure above. The system is placed to the left of 
                        targeted objects we want to test with and the targeted objects are two desktop CNC milling machines.
